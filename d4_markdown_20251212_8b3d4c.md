# Dissipative Resonance Hierarchies

A minimal model of multi-scale self-organization via resonance-enhanced dissipation.

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains code and paper for "Dissipative Resonance Hierarchies: A Minimal Model of Multi-Scale Self-Organization" – a theoretical framework showing how hierarchical self-organization emerges spontaneously in driven, open systems via a *dissipative ratchet* mechanism.

### Key Idea
Three interacting layers bootstrap complexity:
1. **Wave Fields** → form resonant islands via phase synchronization
2. **Metabolic Networks** → reaction rates amplified by wave coherence
3. **Predictive Attractors** → compress trajectories via predictive coding (proto-cognition)

The system selects functional structures through energy flux maximization, eliminating need for fine-tuned parameters.
